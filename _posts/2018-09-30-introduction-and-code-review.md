## Introduction

The Noob SNHUbot project is a Slack chat bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org) originally posted to [GitHub](https://github.com/gsfellis/noob_snhubot) on March 16, 2018.  The project is an enrichment feature brought to the [snhu_coders](https://snhucoders.slack.com) Slack community I established to connect with other technology students enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University.  In its simplest form, the chat bot simply responds to messages directed at it by community members, executes logic scripts and returns the output back to Slack.  While the project began as something fun for me to work on, I decided early on that I wanted it to be a community effort that others could be involved in.  The hope is that other students can use the project to begin their own development journeys outside of the classroom, get familiar with GitHub and open sourced projects, and potentially create their first pull requests.

There are many reasons I elected to leverage this project to build up my portfolio, not the least of which is the enjoyment I've received working on it.  It's a sizable project written in a language that is easy to grasp, with many opportunities for enhancement, aligning itself with the goal of being a collaborative community project.  Furthermore, a recent class, CS-340: Advanced Programming Concepts, allowed me to work in Python to create a RESTful API with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) back end, which I intend to bring to Noob SNHUbot.

As such, the project will allow me to demonstrate an ability to work in a full-stack environment, including the general software development and enhancements, underlying database interface, an ability to work with third-party APIs, and an engineering solutions using appropriate data structures and algorithms.

Lastly, a key factor for including this project in my portfolio is that it draws attention to the passion that I have for software engineering.  I thoroughly enjoy creating software and discussing its many facets.  This passion was a driving factor in starting the Slack community, because it was a facet of our online educational experience that was being overlooked.  Many students have come to get help with their homework assignments, but have stuck around for the comradery the community creates.  Now we hold daily discussions about code, technology, school, dogs, career opportunities, and many other topics with over two-hundred fifty members from all walks of life.  In the age of online and distance learning the lack of connection with other students can not be understated and [snhu_coders](https://snhucoders.slack.com) is doing its part in bringing students together who otherwise may never have met silently earning their degrees.

I'm incredibly proud of the [snhu_coders](https://snhucoders.slack.com) community, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to bring new features to the Slack bot connected to it.

Without further adieu, I present the project in its current state and discuss the changes I wish to bring to it.

In this video I detail the starting functionality of the Noob SNHUbot project, performing a code review and demonstration of it's features and short comings while detailing the proposed enhancements that will take place throughout the CS499 milestones.
