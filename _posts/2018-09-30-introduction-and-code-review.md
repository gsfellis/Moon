## Introduction

The originating artifact elected for enhancement for this and future milestones is a Slack chat bot called Noob SNHUbot, originally posted to GitHub on March 16, 2018.  The project was an enrichment feature brought to the SNHU_coders Slack community I established to connect with other technology students enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  In its simplest form, the chat bot simply responds to messages directed at it by members of the community, executes logic scripts and returns the output back to Slack.  Additionally, it’s the hope that other students can use the project to begin their own development journeys outside of the classroom, get familiar with GitHub and open sourced projects, and potentially create their first pull request.

There are several reasons I elected to include this in my portfolio, not the least of which is the enjoyment I’ve received working on this project.  Additionally, it’s a sizeable project with many opportunities for enhancement and written in a language that many consider easy to grasp.  This allows the project to achieve its intended goal of being a collaborative project to work on within a community.  Furthermore, a recent class, CS-340: Advanced Programming Concepts, allowed me to work in Python to create a RESTful API with a MongoDB backend, which I intend to bring to Noob SNHUbot.  This will allow me to demonstrate an ability to work in a full-stack environment, including the general software development and enhancements, the underlying database, an ability to work with third-party APIs, and an ability to engineer solutions using appropriate data structures and algorithms.

Lastly, a key factor for including this project in my portfolio is that it draws attention to the passion that I have for software engineering.  I thoroughly enjoy creating software and discussing its many facets and it’s in this vein I have created a coding community of over two-hundred members seeking to network with likeminded individuals.  Many students have come to get help with their homework assignments and have stuck around for the comradery the community creates.  In the age of online and distance learning the lack of connection with other students can not be understated, and this community does its part in bringing students together who otherwise may never have met silently earning their degrees online.

In this video I detail the starting functionality of the Noob SNHUbot project, performing a code review and demonstration of it's features and short comings while detailing the proposed enhancements that will take place throughout the CS499 milestones.
