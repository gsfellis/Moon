Here I present a quick demonstration of all the code changes and features brought to the Noob SNHUbot project since starting the CS499 Course.  This includes all of the artifacts for the CS499 portfolio, as well as a new feature implemented by our first contributor.  I even talk about some of the changes I'd like to update and stumble across a bug in my code.
