The new year has arrived, the holidays and vacations are finally behind me and school is long in the rear view mirror.  In trying to keep my learning moving in a positive direction, I'm going to be pushing myself to complete <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">100 Days of Code!</a> I've never attempted anything like this, and I look forward to seeing what I can accomplish over these next 100 days of 2019!

I'm easing my way in to it so I hopped on <a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Code Wars</a> and checked out some available Katas for Python. I came across one that piqued my interest called <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-smiley-faces/train/python" target="_blank">"Count the smiley faces!"</a>. In this challange, I was given an array (or list) of strings, each item containing several characters. I needed to determine how many of them were valid smiley faces based on their specific criteria. This is seemed to be a simple regular expression problem that I felt would be good to start down this journey on the right foot.  I intend to dig much deeper into various coding projects, but I was busy hosting our annual New Years Game Day, so I wanted to make sure I got something completed before the end of the day.  With that said, let's dig into this problem.

Based on their criteria, valid smileys consist of `:) :D ;-D :~)`. Knowing this, I constructed a regex that would account for these variances. The eyes can be a colon or semi-colon, optional nose of a dash of tilde, and the mouth should be a capital 'D' or right parenthesis. Whenever I have a regex problem, I jump over to <a href="https://regex101.com" target="_blank">RegEx101</a> to make sure I have my syntax correct and can perform some practice samples. There I came up with `"[:;][-~]?[)D]"`. Each group matches one of the characters within while the question mark labels the second grouping as optional.

Jumping over to my Python code I knew I would be using the `re` module, and then I would use `re.compile` to create a regex object that could be used for matching. I began creating a `for` loop to iterate over the items within the list, and was using the `re.match()` function to determine if the item was a match for the regular expression. However, this seemed like an over complication. I remembered back to a [previous post]({% post_url 2018-10-30-python-map-filter-lambda %}) I wrote about the Python `filter` built-in function. I could use this to execute a function over an iterable, which would give me a `filter` object with the results. I knew I could easily cast this as a `list` and check its length to get the total count.

And it worked! A simple solution to a relatively simple problem.

```python
import re

def count_smileys(arr):
    r = re.compile(r"[:;][-~]?[)D]")
    
    return len(list(filter(r.match, arr)))
```

So there it is, day 1 of 100 Days of Code! I only spent a few minutes on this one, but sometimes that's what I'll be able to get done, and that's ok. Small steps are still steps forward.
