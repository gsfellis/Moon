Hello, I'm Greg. Yes, that's a picture of James A. Garfield. He was a great president with an amazing beard. Also, I like lasagna.

I'm an experienced technologist with a passionate about leveraging code to solve problems, currently employed as a Senior Systems Support Engineer.  I love automating processes and programming tools to help people get things done.

My Hogwartz house is Ravenclaw, who prize intelligence, wisdom, and learning above all.  As such, I'm a lifelong learner striving to discover new knowledge to leverage in my endeavors.  I'm completing the capstone course for a Bachelor of Science Degree in [Computer Science](https://www.snhu.edu/online-degrees/bachelors/bs-in-computer-science) from [Southern New Hampshire University](https://www.snhu.edu) while supplementing my knowledge with MOOC courses as I look towards the future.

As my degree completion looms, I'm seeking opportunities to bring my technical and programming experiences, desire to learn new things, and sparkling personality to the right kind of company, team, and role where my contributions will have a positive impact towards resolving interesting problems.  If you'd like to review my resume, you may find the latest copy [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/docs/Gregory Fellis Resume.pdf).
