Hello, I'm Greg. Yes, that's a picture of James A. Garfield. He was a great president with an amazing beard. Also, I like lasagna.

I live in the quiet rurals of New Hampshire with my wife, dog, cat, and chickens. I'm just your average "programmer-at-heart, Python enthusiast, lifelong learner, Ravenclaw" that enjoys solving interesting problems with code.

I'm completing the capstone course for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University.
